# K-Means Clustering Project Overview

## Introduction to K-Means Clustering
K-Means Clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used in data analysis. It aims to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets (clusters) based on their features. The algorithm assigns each data point to the cluster whose centroid is nearest.

## Detailed Explanation of K-Means Clustering
K-Means works by iterating the following steps:
1. **Initialization**: K initial centroids are chosen randomly.
2. **Assignment**: Each data point is assigned to the closest centroid.
3. **Update**: The centroids are recalculated as the mean of all points in the cluster.

This process is repeated until the positions of the centroids stabilize, indicating that the clusters are as good as they can be given the current setup.

### Features of K-Means Clustering
- **Efficiency**: Generally fast and efficient in terms of computational cost.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand.

## How to Use K-Means Clustering
1. **Data Preparation**: Standardize your dataset and determine the number of clusters (K).
2. **Algorithm Implementation**: Apply the K-Means algorithm using a library like Scikit-learn or a custom implementation.
3. **Results Analysis**: Observe the clustering results and interpret them in the context of your dataset.

## Evaluation Metrics for K-Means
Evaluating the performance of K-Means clustering can be done using various metrics:
- **Inertia**: Measures how internally coherent clusters are.
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
- **Davies-Bouldin Index**: Lower values indicate better clustering.

## Getting Started
- **Prerequisites**: Install necessary Python libraries like NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
- **Running the Algorithm**: Execute the clustering script on your dataset.
- **Visualizing Results**: Use plots to visualize the clusters and centroids for better understanding.
