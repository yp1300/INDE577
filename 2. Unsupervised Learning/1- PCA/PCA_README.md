# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Project Overview

## Introduction to Principal Component Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction. It transforms a set of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. This technique is widely used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models.

## Detailed Explanation of PCA
PCA involves the following steps:
1. **Standardization**: The data is standardized to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.
2. **Covariance Matrix Computation**: It captures the variance and covariance among variables.
3. **Eigenvalue Decomposition**: Identifies the principal components that capture the most variance in the data.
4. **Projection**: Original data is projected onto a new set of orthogonal axes (principal components).

### Features of PCA
- **Data Visualization**: Helps in visualizing high-dimensional data.
- **Noise Reduction**: By keeping only significant components, noise in data can be reduced.
- **Feature Extraction**: Efficiently extracts the most important features from the dataset.

## How to Use PCA
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize or standardize your dataset.
2. **Apply PCA**: Use PCA to reduce dimensions of the data while preserving as much information as possible.
3. **Model Building**: Use the transformed dataset to build your machine learning models.

## Evaluation Metrics for PCA
- **Explained Variance**: Indicates the proportion of the dataset's variance that lies along each principal component.
- **Scree Plot**: A line plot of the eigenvalues which helps to decide the number of principal components to keep.

## Getting Started with PCA
- **Prerequisites**: Install Python libraries like NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
- **Implementation**: Apply PCA on your dataset using Python libraries.
- **Result Analysis**: Analyze the output to understand the impact of dimensionality reduction on your data.
