# Reinforcement Learning Project

## Introduction
This project is dedicated to exploring and implementing reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. RL is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.

## Explanation
Reinforcement learning involves training models to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment. In RL, an agent makes observations and takes actions within an environment, and in return, it receives rewards. Its objective is to learn to act in a way that will maximize its expected long-term rewards.

## How to Use
1. **Setup Environment**: Set up your environment by installing the necessary libraries and dependencies.
2. **Run Experiments**: Use the provided scripts to run experiments with different RL algorithms.
3. **Analyze Results**: Analyze the results from the experiments to understand the behavior and performance of the algorithms.
4. **Modify and Experiment**: Modify the environment or algorithms to test different scenarios and observe the outcomes.
