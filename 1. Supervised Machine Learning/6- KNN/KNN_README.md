# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Project Overview

## Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, yet effective, machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified. KNN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification.

## Detailed Explanation of KNN
The KNN algorithm works as follows:
1. **Choose the number of K**: Select the number of nearest neighbors.
2. **Calculate Distance**: Compute the distance between the query point and all the available points.
3. **Sort the Distances**: Sort these distances and take the top K nearest neighbors from the sorted list.
4. **Vote for Labels**: For classification, the most frequent label of these neighbors is used as the label for the query point.

### Key Features of KNN
- **Non-parametric**: No assumptions about the shape of the data.
- **Versatility**: Can be used for both classification and regression.

## Implementing KNN
1. **Prepare Data**: Normalize your data and split it into training and testing sets.
2. **Choosing K**: Select an appropriate value for K.
3. **Distance Calculation**: Compute the distance between data points using a method like Euclidean distance.
4. **Model Training**: Fit the KNN algorithm to the training data.
5. **Model Prediction**: Predict the output for the testing data.

## Evaluation Metrics for KNN
- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Useful for multi-class classification problems.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: For regression problems, measures the average of the squares of the errors.

## Getting Started with KNN
- **Prerequisites**: Familiarity with Python and basic machine learning concepts.
- **Libraries**: Utilize libraries like Scikit-learn for an easy implementation.
- **Experimentation**: Test with different values of K and distance metrics to see their effect on the results.
