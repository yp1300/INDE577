# Perceptron Project Overview

## Introduction to Perceptron
The perceptron is a fundamental building block in neural networks and machine learning. It is a type of linear classifier that uses a set of weights to make predictions based on input features. Developed by Frank Rosenblatt, it represents the simplest form of a neural network used for binary classification tasks.

## Detailed Explanation of Perceptron
The perceptron model works as follows:
1. **Input Features**: It receives multiple input signals (features).
2. **Weighted Sum**: Each input feature is multiplied by a weight and summed.
3. **Activation Function**: The weighted sum is then passed through an activation function (like a step function) to produce the output.

### Key Concepts
- **Weights**: Determine the influence of each input feature on the output.
- **Bias**: A constant added to the weighted sum, allowing the perceptron to shift the activation function.
- **Learning Rule**: The perceptron updates its weights based on the errors it makes to improve its predictions.

## Implementing the Perceptron
1. **Initialize Weights**: Start with random weights.
2. **Calculate Output**: For each input, calculate the output of the perceptron.
3. **Update Weights**: Adjust the weights based on the error (difference between predicted and actual output).
4. **Repeat**: Perform multiple iterations over the dataset to refine the weights.

## Evaluation Metrics for Perceptron
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision and Recall**: Measure the quality of the classifier in terms of positive predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Helps in understanding the types of errors made by the classifier.

## Getting Started with the Perceptron
- **Setup**: Install necessary libraries like NumPy for Python.
- **Training**: Use a dataset to train the perceptron and adjust its weights.
- **Testing**: Evaluate the performance of the perceptron on unseen data.
