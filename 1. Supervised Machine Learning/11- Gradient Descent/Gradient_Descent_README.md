# Gradient Descent Project Overview

## Introduction to Gradient Descent
Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used in machine learning and deep learning to minimize a function. It iteratively moves towards the minimum of a function by taking steps proportional to the negative of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point.

## Detailed Explanation of Gradient Descent
Gradient Descent involves:
1. **Choosing a Starting Point**: Initialize the parameters at a starting point.
2. **Calculating the Gradient**: Compute the gradient of the function at the current point.
3. **Updating the Parameters**: Move in the direction opposite to the gradient by a step size determined by the learning rate.
4. **Repeating the Process**: Continue the process until the gradient is close to zero, indicating a minimum.

### Key Concepts in Gradient Descent
- **Learning Rate**: Determines the size of the steps taken to reach a minimum.
- **Convergence**: The process of approaching the minimum of the function.
- **Batch vs Stochastic vs Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**: Variations based on how much data is used to calculate the gradient at each step.

## How to Implement Gradient Descent
1. **Initialize Parameters**: Start with initial values for the parameters you are optimizing.
2. **Compute Gradient**: Calculate the gradient of your loss function with respect to each parameter.
3. **Update Parameters**: Adjust the parameters in the direction that reduces the loss.
4. **Iterate**: Repeat the process for a set number of iterations or until the loss converges.

## Evaluation Metrics for Gradient Descent
- **Loss Function Value**: Monitor the value of the loss function to ensure it decreases over iterations.
- **Learning Curve**: Plotting the change in the loss function over iterations to observe the learning process.

## Getting Started with Gradient Descent
- **Prerequisites**: Familiarity with calculus and Python programming.
- **Running the Algorithm**: Implement the algorithm in Python using libraries like NumPy or TensorFlow.
- **Analyzing Results**: Evaluate the performance of the algorithm by observing how quickly and accurately it converges.
